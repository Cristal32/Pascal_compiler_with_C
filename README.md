# Pascal compiler with C

This project aimed to create a Pascal compiler. From the lexical, syntaxic and semantic analysis, to the generation of the pseudo-code. 

Sadly this work is unfinished, we couldn't implement all the desired grammar rules, and couldn't work on the interpreter. It's still open for anyone who wants to work on it and finish it. 

## How to use

Simply compile and execute the main.c file, here's what should be displayed upon execution (with the test pascal file test.p):

In order:
1. The generated pseudo-code.
2. The message that the pascal test file has been tested through the lexical, syntaxic and semantic analysis and is correctly written.
3. The table of identifiers (variable, constant, label, function and procedure names)
