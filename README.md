# Pascal compiler with C

This project aimed to create a Pascal compiler. From the lexical, syntaxic and semantic analysis, to the generation of the pseudo-code. 

Sadly this work is unfinished, we couldn't implement all the desired grammar rules, and couldn't work on the interpreter. It's still open for anyone who wants to work on it and finish it.
